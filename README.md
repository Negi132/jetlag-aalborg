# Hide + Seek — Aalborg seeker map

A seeker's map for the home version of *Jet Lag: The Game*'s Hide + Seek. You log each answer
the hider gives you; the map shades away everywhere they can't be. The number in the corner is
how many km² are left.

Everything runs in the browser. No build step, no server, no API keys.

## Put it on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repo and drop `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js` into the root.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.
3. Wait a minute. It's live at `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Add it to your phone's home screen before game day — it's built for one-handed use on a bus.

## About Google Maps

You asked for Google Maps, and it's worth being straight about why this doesn't use it.

- **The API key problem.** GitHub Pages serves static public files, so a Maps API key is
  visible to anyone who views source. You can restrict it by HTTP referrer and cap the billing,
  but it's a key on a public page tied to a billing account.
- **Google's terms don't permit its tiles in Leaflet**, so you'd have to rewrite the whole
  rendering layer against the Maps JS API — a different polygon API, different overlay panes,
  different event model.
- **You'd lose nothing visually.** The satellite layer here is Esri's imagery, which is
  comparable, and the default "Plain" basemap is deliberately low-contrast so the shaded
  areas actually read.

All the geometry is done with [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) and is completely independent of
the basemap, so if you later decide you want Google, only the drawing code changes. Three
basemaps ship in the **Game** tab: Plain, Streets, Satellite.

## How each question narrows the map

Every answer becomes a polygon of *places the hider could still be*. They all get intersected
together, and whatever survives is the bright area.

| Question | What gets drawn |
|---|---|
| **Radar** — "are you within ___ of me?" | A circle. *Yes* keeps the inside, *no* keeps the outside. |
| **Thermometer** — "after travelling ___, am I hotter or colder?" | The perpendicular bisector between your start and end point. *Hotter* keeps the half nearer the end point. |
| **Measuring** — "compared to me, are you closer to or further from ___?" | A circle centred on the thing, with a radius equal to *your* distance from it. |
| **Matching** — "is your nearest ___ the same as mine?" | Drop a pin on every candidate in the play area and tap the one nearest you. The map splits into nearest-point territories; you keep yours, or everything but yours. |
| **Tentacles** | Same as matching, plus a radius limit around you. Also handles "not within reach". |
| **Zone** | Same district / parish / postal code as you — one tap on a loaded zone layer. |
| **Free shape** | Draw anything by hand. This is your catch-all for photo clues, sightlines, and hunches. |

Two things worth knowing:

- **Muting beats deleting.** Each logged answer has a ◉ toggle. If the map goes black — meaning
  no area is left — one of your answers is wrong. Mute them one at a time to find the culprit
  instead of starting over.
- **Measuring works on point features.** For coastlines, the Limfjord, and administrative
  borders, draw a free shape instead; a single pin can't represent a line.

## Zones for Aalborg

The **Zones** tab pulls live boundaries from [Dataforsyningen](https://dataforsyningen.dk/)
(the Danish government's open address and geography API — free, no key):

- **Postal districts** — the natural "same zone?" question for a city game
- **Parishes (sogne)** — a finer grid when postal districts get too coarse
- **Municipality outline** — also usable as your play-area boundary

If your phone can't reach the API mid-game, grab the file beforehand on a laptop and load it
with **Load a GeoJSON file**:

```
https://api.dataforsyningen.dk/postnumre?kommunekode=851&format=geojson&landpostnumre
https://api.dataforsyningen.dk/sogne?kommunekode=851&format=geojson
https://api.dataforsyningen.dk/kommuner/0851?format=geojson
```

`851` is Aalborg Kommune. Any other GeoJSON works too — NT bus zones, your own neighbourhood
carve-up — and you can draw zones by hand and export them.

## Sharing a game

The full game state lives in the URL. Every answer you log rewrites it, so:

- **Refresh-safe** — reloading doesn't lose your game.
- **Copy game link** hands your co-seeker the identical map.
- **Export / Import** writes a JSON file for a game you want to keep.

Nothing is sent anywhere. There's no backend.

## Tweaking it

The top of `app.js`:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  center: [57.0488, 9.9217],   // opening view
  zoom: 12,
  playRadiusKm: 10,            // default play area
  kommunekode: '851',          // Aalborg
  radarPresets: [100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]  // metres
};
```

Set `radarPresets` to whatever radii your group agreed on — the official rulebook's radars are
sized for intercity games and are far too big for one city.

Colours are CSS custom properties at the top of `styles.css`.

A live game is on `window.HS` if you want to poke at it from the console:

```js
HS.S.constraints          // everything you've logged
HS.addZoneLayer('Bus zones', myGeoJSON)
HS.setCircularPlayArea(HS.map.getCenter(), 4)
```

## Tests

`geometry.test.mjs` checks the constraint maths against analytically known answers — that a
"no" radar leaves exactly the play area minus the circle, that the thermometer bisector lands
on the midpoint, that contradictory answers are detected.

```
npm install @turf/turf@7.2.0
node geometry.test.mjs
```

Worth running if you change how a question type works.
